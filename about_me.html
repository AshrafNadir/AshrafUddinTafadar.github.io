									<p>Hello! I'm <b>Ashraf Uddin Tafadar</b>, a data analyst with a strong foundation in <b>Python, SQL, R, Power BI, Tableau, Excel</b> and familiarity in other tools. My journey in data analysis is fueled by a passion for uncovering meaningful insights from raw data and transforming them into actionable solutions. 
										I hold a <b>Bachelor's degree in Computer Science</b> from Shahjalal University of Science & Technology and a <b>Master's in Data Analytics</b> from the University of Brighton. </p>

										<p>Throughout my academic and professional journey, I've honed my skills in tackling complex datasets, solving real-world problems, and delivering results that make an impact. One of my proudest achievements was my <b>Master's final year project</b>, where I worked with a renowned bus company to analyze and integrate data from three distinct datasets. 
										 I collaborated closely with my supervisor and the company’s stakeholder—who was non-technical—presenting my findings in a way that was clear and actionable.
										This project not only challenged my technical expertise but also allowed me to fulfill interested parties specific requirements successfully.

										I’ve had the opportunity to work on several team projects, both during my Bachelor’s and Master’s programs. These experiences have strengthened my ability to collaborate effectively, share ideas, and solve problems as part of a group.</p>
										
										<p>I thrive on the immediate gratification of seeing results while analyzing data and enjoy the process of crafting meaningful stories from seemingly disconnected numbers. Collaboration, problem-solving, and clear communication are at the core of my work ethic, allowing me to thrive in team environments and deliver exceptional outcomes.
										
										I'm committed to building a career where I can continue doing what I love—diving deep into data, uncovering insights, and helping organizations make data-driven decisions. Feel free to check out my portfolio and reach out if you’re looking for a data analyst with hands-on experience and a passion for solving problems.
										
										</p>
